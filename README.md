This project is based on Django Framework on Python. Instead of using a naive email system, we have added a voice based feature to make it more innovative.

Working : 
1. On opening localhost, the webpage is active. On clicking login, the user is re-directed to login page where voice based instructions are provided to login.
2. After Login/Sign-up, the user is re-directed to the mail page where the mail is composed and sent to the user's email id.
3. After the mail is sent, the user is re-directed back to the landing page.

Install : 
1. Django installation(pip install django)
2. Install requirements.txt
